# ARENA-work
Cody Rushing's repository to hold exercises and open ended projects from the 2022 Virtual ARENA program

This is my collection of activities I've done. Starting from October 17, I've put around four hours a day into these.
Some highlights of my work, so far, include:
Week one:
- Implementing CNNs from scratch
- Building resnet34 from scratch
