# ARENA-work
Cody Rushing's repository to hold exercises and open ended projects from the 2022 Virtual ARENA program

This is my collection of activities I've done. Starting from October 17, I've put around two-three hours a day into these.
Some highlights of my work, so far, include:

Week three:
- Learned about, and built, basic optimizers
- Examined scaling laws, and replicated them - report [here!](https://wandb.ai/starship006/Scaling_Laws_CNN/reports/Reproducing-Scaling-Laws--VmlldzoyOTYwNTU4?accessToken=3tbyptjw9xdp8kc81pl1edd1zch052ug2lk2tx5svg5p8br82ejvtvpg0ozvybna)

Week two:
- Learned how to use Wandb for hyperparameter sweeps and optimization. Also played around with reports [here](https://wandb.ai/starship006/w2d1_resnet/reports/First-Report---VmlldzoyOTE4NDAy?accessToken=9ldl319rrvdabls34mhc3z8i1uck0mgmgtmwnoi24nl6f7w90z2x2gb9o6e0ivci)
- Recreated a... rather broken version of GPT-2. Not working as expected, as of 11/8

Week one:
- Implementing a decoder-only transformer from scratch (so far it can reverse numbers!)
- Used the baseline transformer, coupled with decoder methods, to produce my own [Shakespeare](https://github.com/starship006/ARENA-work/blob/main/w1/w1d4.ipynb) (~25 min of training with free Colab GPUs!)

Week zero:
- Implementing CNNs from scratch
- Building resnet34 from scratch
- Learning some fundamental libraries: einops, ensum
